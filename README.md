### Project Introduction
Performance review of lowcost PM2.5 sensors for ambient air quality monitoring over expensive high end Gas and PM sensors.¶

### Our Approach
We will compare and analyse data collected using a air quality monitoring station established at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and compare this with PM2.5 readings from multiple sesnors that people install in their home and broadcast data freely for public use. <br>
The UIUC sensor is manufactured by UK based company AQMesh and broadcasts readings via a Mobile network every 15 minutes. The recorded values include readings for CO, NO, NO2, Ozone, CO2, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, pressure and humidity. This is a relatively expensive sensor with ongoing expenses for replacement of parts. The cost is in the range of  15𝑘𝑡𝑜 25k. <br>
PurpleAir Sensor is a low cost sensor that can be deployed easily for less than $200. There are about 22000 live purple air sensors today. The data from these is open-access. Urbana-Champaign has 3 live purople air sensors.

### Hypothesis
1 - PM2.5 represents the ambient air quality. <br>
2 - There is a relationship between PM2.5 and time <br>
3 - There is a relationship between PM2.5 and Weather (Temp, Humidity and Wind Speed) <br>
4- CO, NOx and Ozone concentrations are related to the time of the day. <br>
